# Tracking the International Space Stations - DEMO APP

This is an experimental app, stuff still in progress. 

The above-fold screen shows current position of ISS and the Chinese Space Station as well as a list of current astronauts on these vessels.

The second half of the screen allows to brows historical movements of these. NOTE: The database behind this app was collected within a few days, containing about 2 hours worth of GPS coordinates per day.

## Where can you see the app running?
