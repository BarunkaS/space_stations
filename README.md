# Tracking the International Space Stations

This is an experimental app, stuff still in progress. I mostly wanted to play around with creating modules, deploying Postgre-based backend for a Streamlit hosted app.

## Next steps

- Collect more data and create an orchestration for it.
- Beautify current map with icons and current positions.
