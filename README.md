# Tracking the International Space Stations - DEMO APP


The above-fold screen shows current position of ISS and the Chinese Space Station as well as a list of current astronauts on these vessels.

The second half of the screen allows to brows historical movements of these.

## Where can you see the app running?

The app was deployed using Streamlit with postgreSQL on Heroku. Heroku is canceling their free tier as of Nov 2022, so I retired the app.
